VP of Partnerships",Something relevant from TechSparks week — Mabel,"Hi Mabel,

Hope the TechSparks energy has carried into this week.

I've been thinking about something relevant to Open Financial Technologies — staying ahead of fast-moving pricing changes in the fintech industry. It's a pattern we keep seeing with founders at your stage: the commercial intelligence work that should be informing pricing and competitive positioning is either delayed, manual, or not happening at the frequency needed.

Pricing intelligence and competitive benchmarking data would be highly relevant to Mabel in optimizing her company's pricing and product strategy.

The companies getting ahead of this are using automated data pipelines to do in real-time what used to take an analyst a week — monitoring competitor pricing, tracking assortment gaps, benchmarking before board reviews.

If any of this resonates, I can introduce you to a YC-backed company that specializes in exactly this. They work with several Indian founders in your category and the conversation is worth 20 minutes.
